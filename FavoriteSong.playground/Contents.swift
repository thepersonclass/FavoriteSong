 Decription: This is part of the Swift course being offered by pirple.com. The cource is broken up over 3 parts and this is part 1 of the class.
 It revolved mostly around the core syntax of Swift. The first assignment is create a playground that outlines the meta-data of my favorite song.
 The assignment is designed to get students accustmed to using variables and there various types. This is way this is not represented in something
 like a class or JSON.
 Homework Assignment: 1 (Favorite Song)

If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Lord mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Don't it make you feel bad
When you're tryin' to find your way home
You don't know which way to go?
If you're goin' down South
They got no work to do
If you don't know about Chicago
Cryin' won't help you prayin' won't do you no good
Now cryin' won't help you prayin' won't do you no good
When the levee breaks mama you got to move
All last night sat on the levee and moaned
All last night sat on the levee and moaned
Thinkin' 'bout me baby and my happy home
Going to Chicago
Going to Chicago
Sorry but I can't take you
Going down, going down now, going down
Going down now, going down
Going down, going down, going down
Going down now, going down
Going down now, going down
Going down now, going down
Going d-d-d-d-down
Woo, woo
